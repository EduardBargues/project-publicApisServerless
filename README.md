# project-publicApisServerless

Repository containing a functional example of how to expose a set of secure public apis supported by Serverless technologies. The security is composed by a 3 layer infrastructure:

- mutual TLS.
- IP whitelisting.
- JWT based authentication.

The repository uses Terraform as IaC, Python as main coding language, and bash for scripting.
